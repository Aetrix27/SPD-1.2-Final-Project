# SPD-1.2-Final-Project
 
This project uses Flask and Jinja 2 Templating. The landing page shows primary information and a call to action. The second page allows users to preview preset data from arrays (Medical Documents), and will later allow previewing of the file the user uploads. The last page shows information, a sign up form, and a location using an imported Google Maps API.
